# raspberry-pi-pico-w-wireless-ap

A simple project that creates an wireless access point on Raspberry Pi Pico W.

This project is intended to provide a minimal example of a working code to compile and run on your Raspberry Pi Pico W board. I created this repository because I believe it will be useful for some developers that just received theirs boards and are struggling with docs and complex examples.

The SDK installation steps should follow the [raspberry official docs](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf).
